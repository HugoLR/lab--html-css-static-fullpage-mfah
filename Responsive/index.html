        <h2>About the MFH</h2>
        <p>Established in 1900, the MFAH is the largest cultural institution in the southwest region. The Museum’s main campus is <br />located in the heart of Houston’s Museum District, and comprises the Audrey Jones Beck Building, the Caroline Wiess <br /> Law Building, the Glassell School of Art, and the Lillie and Hugh Roy Cullen Sculpture Garden. Nearby, two remarkable <br /> house museums—Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, and Rienzi—present collections of American and European <br /> decorative arts. Resources that can be found throughout the MFAH include a repertory cinema, two significant <br /> research libraries, public archives, and a conservation and storage facility. The encyclopedic collections of the MFAH <br />cover world cultures dating from antiquity to the present and include in-depth holdings of American art, European <br /> paintings, pre-Columbian and African gold, decorative arts and design, photography, prints and drawings, Modern and <br /> Contemporary painting and sculpture, and Latin American art. The MFAH is also home to the International Center for <br />the Arts of the Americas (ICAA), a leading research institute for 20th-century Latin American and Latino art.</p>

        <h2>Architectural Legacy</h2>
        <p>The MFAH campus unites the brilliant architectural and design work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Isamu Noguchi, and <br />Rafael Moneo, part of a 75-year legacy of inspired commissions that spans from 1924—and the construction of the <br /> original Museum building designed by William Ward Watkin in the Neoclassical style—to the year 2000, when the <br />Museum completed the Rafael Moneo-designed Audrey Jones Beck Building.</p>

        <h2>Future of the MFAH Campus</h2>
        <div class="five-container">
          <p>The firm Steven Holl Architects is developing plans for a <br />comprehensive project to create a new building for 20th-<br /> and 21st-century art and a new facility for the Glassell <br /> School of Art; those structures will link to the existing <br />gallery buildings by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Rafael <br /> Moneo, as well as the sculpture garden by Isamu <br /> Noguchi, establishing a 14-acre public campus in the <br /> heart of Houston’s Museum District.</p>

            <h5>Director: William C. Agee</h5>
            <h5>Year: 1979</h5>
            <p>By the mid-1970s, the Museum needed a new facility for its school <br /> of art to  accommodate the growing student body. Under the <br /> guidance of Museum  director William C. Agee, and with a generous <br /> donation from Alfred Glassell, Jr., a plan for an approximately <br /> 42,000-square-foot building was drawn up by  architects Eugene <br /> Aubry and R. Nolen Willis of the prominent Houston firm S.  I. Morris <br /> and Associates. The building—a two-story space made from <br />concrete and glass-block, and located one block north of the <br /> Museum—represented the first time that the school had a home of <br />its own in its 52-year history. The Glassell School of Art opened to <br /> the public on January 13, 1979.</p>
